## Project Name: code_challenge_reviewer

## Path: src/agents.py

## Explain This:
This Python module defines a set of classes for creating and managing different types of agents for specific tasks, such as performing code reviews, extracting file paths, and fetching file content using GitHub API. Additionally, it includes a class to facilitate logging outputs into a Streamlit expander.

## Code Review:
### Code Quality:
- The code is generally well-structured and follows Pythonic conventions.
- Docstrings are provided for each method and class, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- Use of try-except blocks ensures error handling, improving the robustness of the code.

### Bugs:
- No significant bugs were found in the code. However, it's recommended to log the stack trace along with the error message for better debugging.

### Anti-Patterns:
- Use of hardcoded strings within methods. These could be replaced with constants or loaded from a configuration file.
- The `StreamToExpander` class's `write` method is performing too many operations. It would be better to refactor it for clarity and maintainability.

### Improvements:
- **Logging**: Enhance error logging with stack traces for more comprehensive debugging information.
- **Configuration**: Use constants or configuration files for hardcoded values to make the code more flexible and maintainable.
- **Method Refactoring**: Refactor the `write` method in `StreamToExpander` for better readability and performance.

### Compliance:
- The code complies with common coding standards and best practices, such as PEP 8 for Python.
- It uses proper exception handling and logging, which are crucial for production-level code.

## Updated Code:
```python

import logging
from crewai import Agent
import streamlit as st
from tools import Tools

# Set up logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
