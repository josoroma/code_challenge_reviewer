my best complete final answer to the task.

## Project Name: code_challenge_reviewer

## Path: src/github_helper.py

## Explain This:
This script is designed to fetch and display the tree structure of a GitHub repository. It uses the GitHub API to get the contents of the repository and then recursively prints the structure, ignoring specific folders like 'public', 'images', 'media', and 'assets'. It also sets up logging to capture and log errors that might occur during the API request.

## Code Review:
### Code Quality:
- The code is generally well-structured and easy to follow.
- Docstrings are provided for the main function, which is good for understanding the purpose and usage of the function.
- The use of logging is a good practice for capturing runtime issues.
- The script uses environment variables for sensitive information, which is a good practice for security.

### Bugs:
- There are no apparent bugs in the code. However, there are some areas that could be improved for better error handling and performance.

### Anti-Patterns:
- Using a mutable default argument (`path: str = ""`) can lead to unintended behavior. It's better to use `None` and then set it inside the function.
- The function `get_file_tree` prints output directly using `st.code`, which makes it less flexible for other types of outputs or testing.

### Improvements:
1. **Mutable Default Argument**: Change `path: str = ""` to `path: Union[str, None] = None` and set it inside the function.
2. **Output Handling**: Instead of directly printing using `st.code`, return the output and let the caller handle the printing.
3. **Type Annotations**: Add type annotations for better clarity and type checking.
4. **Error Handling**: Add more specific exception handling for different types of errors.

### Compliance:
- The code complies with standard Python practices and PEP 8 guidelines.
- Logging and environment variable usage are both good practices for security and debugging.

## Updated Code:
```python
import os
import requests
import logging
from typing import Union, Optional

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Ensure environment variable is set for GITHUB_KEY
GITHUB_KEY = os.getenv('GITHUB_KEY')

def get_file_tree(owner: str, repo: str, path: Optional[str] = None, level: int = 0) -> str:
    """
    Fetch and print the tree structure of a GitHub repository, ignoring specific folders.

    Parameters:
    - owner: The username of the repository owner.
    - repo: The name of the repository.
    - path: The path to fetch. Leave None to fetch the root directory.
    - level: The current depth in the tree structure.

    Returns:
    - str: The tree structure as a string.
    """
    if path is None:
        path = ""

    # Directories to ignore
    ignore_dirs = {'public', 'images', 'media', 'assets'}

    api_url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}"
    headers = {'Authorization': f'token {GITHUB_KEY}'}

    output = ""

    try:
        # Make the request
        response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers, verify=True)  # Security improvement
        response.raise_for_status()
        items = response.json()

        if isinstance(items, list):
            for item in items:
                # Skip ignored directories
                if item['name'] in ignore_dirs:
                    continue

                item_name = f"{' ' * (level * 2)}- {item['name']}"
                output += f"{item_name}\n"

                if item['type'] == 'dir':
                    output += get_file_tree(owner, repo, item['path'], level + 1)

        return output

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        logging.error(f"Request error: {str(e)}")
        return ""
    except ValueError:
        logging.error("Error: Unable to parse the response from GitHub.")
        return ""
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}")
        return ""
```

This updated code improves type safety, error handling, and separates concerns by returning the output instead of directly printing it, which makes it more versatile and easier to test.
