## Project Name: code_challenge_reviewer

## Path: src/agents.py

## Explain This:
This file defines classes and methods for creating and managing different types of agents and streaming logs to a Streamlit expander. It includes the `Agents` class, which defines methods to create agents for code reviews, file path extraction, and fetching file content using the GitHub API. Additionally, the `StreamToExpander` class is used to stream log data to a Streamlit expander, filtering out ANSI escape codes and displaying task-related information.

## Code Review:
### Code Quality:
- The code is well-organized and modular, with each agent creation encapsulated within its method.
- Docstrings are provided for classes and methods, enhancing readability and maintainability.
- Proper logging is implemented to handle exceptions.

### Bugs:
- No apparent bugs were found in the given code.

### Anti-Patterns:
- The `StreamToExpander` class uses a mutable default argument (`colors` list). Although this is not directly causing an issue here, it's generally considered a bad practice.

### Improvements:
1. **Mutable Default Argument**: Avoid using mutable default arguments. Change `colors` to be a class attribute instead.
2. **Logging Configuration**: Consider making the logging configuration more flexible by allowing it to be set externally.
3. **Exception Handling**: The `logging.error` calls should include the actual exception message to provide more context.
4. **Documentation**: More detailed docstrings for methods in `StreamToExpander` would be beneficial.

### Compliance:
- The code adheres to PEP 8 standards.
- Logging and exception handling are implemented correctly.

## Updated Code:
```python
import re
import logging
from crewai import Agent
import streamlit as st
from tools import Tools

# Set up logging configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
