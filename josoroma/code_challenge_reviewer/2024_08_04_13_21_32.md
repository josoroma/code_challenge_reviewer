## Project Name: code_challenge_reviewer

## Path: src/agents.py

## Explain This:
The `agents.py` file defines two main components: the `Agents` class and the `StreamToExpander` class. The `Agents` class is responsible for creating different types of agents (review, path, and content) with specific roles, goals, and backstories. These agents are configured to perform tasks such as code reviews, extracting file paths, and fetching file content using GitHub API. The `StreamToExpander` class is a utility to handle streaming data to a Streamlit expander, filtering out ANSI escape codes, and displaying task-specific messages as toasts.

### Code Quality:
- The code is well-structured and modular, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Docstrings are provided for classes and methods which is a good practice.
- Constants are appropriately used for agent roles, goals, and backstories.

### Bugs:
- No obvious bugs are found in the provided code.

### Anti-Patterns:
- The `StreamToExpander` class had unnecessary attributes like `colors` and `color_index` which were not used anywhere in the class. These have been removed in the updated code.

### Improvements:
- Removed the unused attributes `colors` and `color_index` from the `StreamToExpander` class.
- Simplified the `write` method in the `StreamToExpander` class by removing redundant code.

### Compliance:
- The code complies with standard logging practices.
- The exception handling captures errors and logs them appropriately without exposing sensitive information.
