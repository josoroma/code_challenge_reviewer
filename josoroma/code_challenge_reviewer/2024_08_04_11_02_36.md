# code_challenge_reviewer - src/tasks.py



## Project Name: code_challenge_reviewer.
## Path: src/tasks.py.
## Explain This:
The `Tasks` class is responsible for creating and managing various types of tasks related to code review, file path extraction, and file content fetching using the GitHub API. Each method within the class configures a task with specific parameters and returns a `Task` object that can be used to perform the respective actions.

## Code Review:
### Code Quality:
- The code is generally well-structured and follows standard Python conventions.
- Docstrings are provided for each method, which improves readability and maintainability.
- The use of f-strings for formatting strings is efficient and clean.

### Bugs:
- No apparent bugs are present in the code.

### Anti-Patterns:
- The use of print statements for error handling can be improved. It would be better to use logging for better control over error messages and levels of severity.

### Improvements:
1. **Error Handling**: Replace print statements with logging for better error management.
2. **Type Hinting**: Add type hints to method parameters and return types to improve code clarity and prevent potential type-related bugs.
3. **Consistent Exception Handling**: Ensure consistent handling of exceptions across all methods.

### Compliance:
- The code complies with PEP 8 standards, including the use of docstrings and proper indentation.
- The code does not expose any sensitive information and adheres to standard security practices.

                    Review the given file and provide detailed feedback and a code review to ensure it adheres to industry code quality standards.

                    - Take the file path and file contents from `content_agent`.
                    - Provide a detailed code review with feedback on the following aspects:
                       * Code Quality
                       * Bugs
                       * Anti-Patterns

                       * Compliance
                    - Make necessary improvements to the file content and return the updated content as `updated_code`.

                    Return the following values in the markdown content output:

                    - Project Name: {repo}.
                    - Path: {path}.
                    - Explain This: generate documentation for this code, explain the entire code in a few lines.
                    - Code Review: detailed explain the code review for this code, provide feedback on the code quality, bugs, anti-patterns, improvements, and compliance.
                    - Updated Code: updated code of file after making code review and changes.

                    The attributes returned must be in markdown format, as heading h2 or ## and the value as its nested text.

                    The `Updated Code` output string must be a string in python format. This `Updated Code` output string should be involved by backticks such as ```python updated_code_output ```.

                    You are given a tree structure of folder and repo_directory. First, you have to decide whether it is a folder or file from the given tree structure of a folder.

                    Follow this approach:

                    - If it's a file then return array with 1 element which contains the full path of that file in this folder structure.
                    - If it's a folder then return array of paths of sub files inside that folder. If there is a subfolder in given folder, then return paths for those files as well.
                    - If repo_directory is not present in given tree structure then just return an empty array.

                    Please return the FULL path of a given file in the given folder tree structure. For example, if the tree structure looks like this:

                    {repo_structure}

                    Then the full path of {repo_file_sample} will be "{repo_fullpath_sample}".
