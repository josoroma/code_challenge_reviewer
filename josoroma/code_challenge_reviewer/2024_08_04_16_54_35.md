## Project Name: code_challenge_reviewer

## Path: src/agents.py

## Explain This
This script defines two classes, `Agents` and `StreamToExpander`, to manage different types of agents and to stream data to a Streamlit expander, respectively.

The `Agents` class has methods to create and configure specific types of agents:
- `review_agent()`: Creates an agent configured for performing code reviews.
- `path_agent()`: Creates an agent configured for extracting file paths.
- `content_agent()`: Creates an agent configured for fetching file content using the GitHub API.

The `StreamToExpander` class is designed to stream data to a Streamlit expander widget. It processes data, filters out ANSI escape codes, and displays task information as a toast notification and code snippets within the expander.

## Code Review
### Code Quality
- The code is well-organized and follows standard Python conventions.
- Methods are succinct with clear responsibilities.
- Docstrings are provided for all methods, which is excellent for maintainability.
  
### Bugs
- No significant bugs detected. However, handling of exceptions could be more specific rather than catching general `Exception`.

### Anti-Patterns
- Using a general `Exception` catch block is not recommended as it makes debugging harder.
- The `StreamToExpander.write` method uses a regular expression to filter out ANSI escape codes, which could be simplified and optimized.

### Improvements
- **Exception Handling:** Rather than catching a general `Exception`, catch specific exceptions.
- **Logging:** Improve logging to include more context.
- **Regular Expressions:** Simplify and optimize regular expressions for better performance.
- **Buffer Handling:** Optimize buffer handling in `StreamToExpander`.

### Compliance
- The code generally follows PEP 8 standards.
- Logging configuration is set correctly.

## Updated Code

# Set up logging configuration
